The diff below is line-numbered: on each line, the leading number is that line's
real line number in the file AFTER this change, followed by a marker
(+ added, - removed, blank = unchanged context).

Report only problems you can point at in this diff. For each finding, classify:

severity (pick exactly one):
  bug      - it will produce wrong behaviour, a crash, or data loss
  security - injection, auth/authz gap, leaked secret, unsafe deserialization, path traversal
  perf     - a real efficiency problem at the scale this code runs at
  tests    - behaviour introduced here that needs a test and doesn't have one
  api      - a breaking change to a signature, export, schema, or CLI contract that callers depend on

confidence (be honest, this is the most useful part of the review):
  high     - you can name the concrete input or state that triggers it
  medium   - likely wrong, but it depends on code you cannot see in this diff
  low      - a suspicion worth a second look, nothing more

Rules:
- "file" must be exactly one of the paths listed under FILES CHANGED.
- "line" must be one of the numbers shown in the diff for that file.
- Do NOT report style, formatting, naming preferences, comment density, or
  "consider extracting this" refactors. Those are not findings.
- Do NOT pad the list to look thorough. An empty findings array is a correct,
  respected answer for a clean change, and is far more useful than nitpicks.
- Judge the code as it will exist after the change, not the diff in isolation.
